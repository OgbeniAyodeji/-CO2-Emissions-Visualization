# CO2 Emissions Visualization with D3.js

This project demonstrates my expertise in data visualization using D3.js, analyzing global CO2 emissions trends from 1990 to 2020. Through interactive, web-based visuals, I showcase my ability to transform raw data into compelling insights.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Visualize and analyze CO2 emissions by country to identify trends, top emitters, and growth patterns.  
- **Dataset:** Sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions) (CSV with country, year, emissions).  
- **Analysis:**  
  - Aggregated emissions by country and year.  
  - Calculated growth rates and identified top 10 emitters.  
- **Visualization:**  
  - **Interactive Choropleth Map:** Countries colored by emissions, with hover tooltips (emissions, growth rate) and click-to-zoom line charts.  
  - **Features:** Year slider with smooth transitions, responsive design.  
- **Live Demo:** [View Visualization](https://ogbeniayodeji.github.io/ayodeji-profile/co2_viz.html)
